## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a digital adaptation of the board game *Galaxy Trucker* by Cranio Creations.  
The application is based on a **single-server architecture** capable of handling **multiple concurrent matches**, each supporting **2 to 4 players**.

Players can access the game through either a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** or a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

The project adheres to **software engineering best practices** and makes extensive use of **design patterns**, with a particular emphasis on the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** paradigm.

Technical details regarding networking, communication protocols, and system architecture can be found in the project documentation.
